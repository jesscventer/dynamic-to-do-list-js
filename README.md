Advanced Application of Javascript projects
Dynamic To-Do List Application
This project is a dynamic web-based To-Do List application that allows users to add, display, and remove tasks. A key feature of this application is the integration of Local Storage, which ensures that tasks persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed, providing a seamless user experience.

Features:

HTML Structure: Provides an input field for new tasks, an "Add Task" button, and an unordered list to display tasks.

CSS Styling: Offers a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface with responsive design elements for a pleasant visual experience.

JavaScript Functionality (script.js):

Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button or pressing Enter.

Remove Tasks: Each task listed includes a "Remove" button, allowing users to delete tasks from the list.

DOM Manipulation: Dynamically creates and removes list items (<li>) and buttons to reflect changes.

Local Storage Persistence: Tasks are automatically saved to and loaded from the browser's Local Storage, ensuring data is retained across sessions.

Basic Input Validation: Prompts the user if an attempt is made to add an empty task.

How to Run Locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone 

Navigate to the project directory:

cd dynamic-to-do-list-js

Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

This project is an excellent example of building interactive web applications with JavaScript, focusing on real-time DOM updates and client-side data persistence.
